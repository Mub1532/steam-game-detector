# Steam Game Detector

The Steam Game Detector finds your steam rich presence and converts it into a Discord Presence.

## Installation

Click on the releases tab, download the desired version and run the setup file. (source-code.zip is just the code for this file you are reading now and the screenshots folder)

## Why would I need this?

Some games, such as Apex legends and CSGO support the Steam Rich presence to show what you are doing in the game, for example if you are in a Competitive game, however when you look at discord, it just says Apex Legends for 15 minutes for example. So this would support any game with Steam presence and convert it to a Discord presence

## Hold on. Windows says: Windows protected your pc, is this a virus?

No, its because i have not signed the application with windows, because that costs a lot of money

## How do I Request Game Icons

As you can see in the pictures, the last image shows me playing forza, however the icon is the dafault Steam icon, this is because i havent added that icon to the Discord Application, If you would like a game icon, you can request one in the Discord server listed below.
